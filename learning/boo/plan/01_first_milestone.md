# 🧭 Milestone 1 – Full Learning Plan

## 🎓 **MILESTONE 1: The Knife, the Fire, and the Onion**

**Theme**: *Fundamentals of Movement, Heat, and Taste*
⏱️ Duration: \~3–4 weeks (9–12 lessons)
🎯 Goal: Build the foundation of real cooking logic — how you cut, heat, and season affects **everything**.

---

# 🔪 PHASE 1: **Knife Skills + Mise en Place**

### 🎯 Focus: Movement, Prep, Efficiency

---

### **Lesson 1.1 – Knife Basics + Onion Logic**

* 🔹 Knife safety, grip, how to move safely
* 🔹 Onion anatomy, dicing/mincing technique
* 🔹 Aromatic food behavior: how onions cook and why
* 🧪 Food science: why onions make you cry, why they brown
* 🧼 Includes: How to set up your cutting board/prep station

---

### **Lesson 1.2 – Garlic, Herbs, and Fine Mincing**

* 🔹 Garlic prep: smashing, mincing, paste
* 🔹 Herb logic: hard herbs vs. soft herbs, when to add them
* 🧪 Flavor molecules: alliums + oil = umami
* 🧼 Includes: Keeping your board clean while chopping

---

### **Lesson 1.3 – Other Cuts + Knife Maintenance**

* 🔹 Julienne, batonnet, chiffonade, slice
* 🔹 How to practice speed + consistency
* 🔹 Knife storage, honing vs. sharpening
* 🧪 Food behavior: surface area = speed = flavor extraction
* 🍽️ Practice dish: chopped salad or soup base

---

### **Lesson 1.4 – Mise en Place Mindset**

* 🔹 Organizing your space before cooking
* 🔹 Ingredient bowls, sequence logic, mental cooking flow
* 🧼 Cleaning as you go + trash bowl trick
* 🧪 Kitchen psychology: mise en place = calmer brain

---

# 🔥 PHASE 2: **Heat + Cooking Techniques**

### 🎯 Focus: Controlling Fire and Timing

---

### **Lesson 2.1 – Sauté vs. Sweat vs. Sear**

* 🔹 Definitions, goals, visual cues
* 🔹 When to stir, when to leave it alone
* 🧪 Water + oil + heat = food reaction logic
* 🧼 Managing splatter, pan placement, stovetop cleanup
* 🍽️ Practice dish: sautéed mushrooms, onions, garlic combo

---

### **Lesson 2.2 – Oil & Heat Behavior**

* 🔹 Smoke points, choosing oils
* 🔹 Preheating pans, cold vs. hot oil techniques
* 🧪 Thermal conductivity & food sticking
* 🔥 Practice: dry sauté vs. oiled sauté (mushrooms!)

---

### **Lesson 2.3 – Timing & Doneness**

* 🔹 Visual/tactile cues: doneness without timers
* 🔹 How to layer ingredients based on cook time
* 🧪 Heat transfer science: carryover cooking
* 🍽️ Practice: staggered stir-fry with aromatics + fast veggies

---

### **Lesson 2.4 – Cleanup Flow + Leftover Management**

* 🔹 Clean as you go: rinse, reset, reuse
* 🔹 Storing chopped extras: herbs, onions, garlic, leftovers
* 🔹 Labeling, fridge order, freezing small amounts

---

# 🧂 PHASE 3: **Seasoning + Layering Flavor**

### 🎯 Focus: Taste Logic and Depth

---

### **Lesson 3.1 – Salt, Acid, Fat, Umami (SAFU) Basics**

* 🔹 What each element does in the mouth and brain
* 🔹 How to taste + adjust
* 🧪 Mouthfeel vs. flavor
* 🧂 Practice: Build and fix a simple sauté sauce or broth

---

### **Lesson 3.2 – Layering Flavor in Simple Dishes**

* 🔹 How to build flavor over time: bloom spices, brown onions, reduce liquids
* 🔹 Timing aromatics vs. spices vs. acids
* 🧪 Volatility of aromatics and flavor escape
* 🍽️ Practice dish: shakshuka or tomato sauce base

---

### **Lesson 3.3 – Substitution + Creativity in Basics**

* 🔹 Swapping aromatics: shallot, leek, scallion
* 🔹 What happens if you skip or sub
* 🎨 Building a dish from memory + logic (e.g., “any stir-fry” template)
* 🧼 Managing waste: saving scraps for stock, using extra garlic/onions

---

# 🏁 MILESTONE 1 WRAP-UP

### 🎓 Capstone Practice

* Cook a meal using:

  * Proper knife work
  * A sauté or sweat
  * Balanced seasoning
  * Prepped mise en place
  * Cleanup flow & leftover strategy

### 🧾 Deliverables:

* ✅ Final recipe (clean, with variations)
* ✅ Technique + flavor logic summary
* ✅ Updated learning history
