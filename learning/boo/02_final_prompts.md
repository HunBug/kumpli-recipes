## 🧾 LESSON-WRAP PROMPTS (Use at the end of a lesson)

### 1️⃣ 📋 Final Recipe Prompt (with all notes/remarks)

> **Prompt:**
>
> *"Please give me the final version of today’s recipe, with all the relevant remarks, substitutions, mistakes to avoid, and flavor tips we discussed during the lesson. Include a short intro if useful, and keep it clean and useful for real cooking.
Include a section at the end with storage notes (how long it keeps, how to reheat), and any cleanup or prep tips that apply."*

Use this when you're ready to cook from the knowledge, not just learn about it. This will include every adjustment or extra context we discussed—substitutions, sequencing logic, prep tips, etc.

### 2️⃣ 📚 Summary of Techniques and Lessons Learned (like a school book)

> **Prompt:**
>
> *"Please give me a summary of today’s lesson, structured like a cooking school note: techniques learned, concepts explained, food behavior patterns, science bits, common mistakes, and substitution logic. Make it digestible for review.
At the end, include any tips about ingredient storage, shopping, cleanup/organization, and time-saving techniques used in this lesson."*

This is your "notebook" entry. Useful for memorization, review, or when you want to recall a concept later and see how it generalizes beyond the dish.

### 3️⃣ 🧠 General Culinary Knowledge Prompt (for full cooking history)

>
> *(Paste your current general learning log after this prompt)*

This acts as your personal *cooking brain*. Update it every lesson. It can include summaries of techniques, rules you’ve internalized, food behavior patterns, etc.

>
> *(Paste your current focused knowledge log after this prompt)*

You can copy-paste this for each specialty area and maintain separate logs.
