After uploading files, send this message to ChatGPT:

```
Please read, index, and understand these uploaded files:

Core Instructions:
- recipe-instructions-v2.0.md
- illustration-instructions-v2.0.md

Schema & References:
- conventions/recipe.schema.json
- conventions/story-sections.json

## ✨ What Happens Next

ChatGPT will:
- Generate `recipe.json` files following the schema
- Generate `story.md` files with proper sections
- Create illustration prompts with correct filenames
- Follow creative diversity rules (rotating styles/tones/characters)
- Use the correct folder structure: `recipes/<slug>/recipe.json` + `story.md`
- Use simple image filenames: `illustration.jpg`, `photo-1.jpg`, `photo-2.jpg`

---

## 📦 Folder Structure You'll Create

```
recipes/
  <slug>/
    recipe.json       ← Generated by ChatGPT (validates against schema)
    story.md          ← Generated by ChatGPT (Background, Kumpli Notes, Cooking Moments)
    
images/
  recipes/
    <slug>/
      illustration.jpg   ← Main illustration
      photo-1.jpg        ← First photo
      photo-2.jpg        ← Second photo
      ...
```

---

## 🔧 Validation & Build

After creating recipe files:

```bash
# Validate the recipe
python scripts/validate_recipes.py recipes/<slug>

# Generate HTML and combined markdown
./scripts/build_local.sh

# Preview locally
python -m http.server 8000 --directory dist
```

## 💡 Tips

- Reference the example recipes when unsure about structure
- conventions/recipe.schema.json shows all required/optional fields
- conventions/story-sections.json defines the exact section names to use
- conventions/tags.json provides creative tag vocabulary (not enforced, just suggestions)
- conventions/spice-levels.md explains the Kumpli spice scale
- conventions/multi-recipe-variants.md explains how to create recipe variants
- Always use slug format: lowercase-with-hyphens
- Images in story.md use simple filenames (not full paths)
