# 🥔 Kumpli Recipe Book

Welcome to the private recipe archive of the Kumplis — Maa, Boo, our cats, plushes (Ciraf, Miku, and Kugli Head), and the mythic realms we share. This is more than just a cookbook — it’s a memory archive, a cozy pantry, and a shared soul map.

We use ChatGPT as our helper to format, organize, and write down recipes with Kumpli-flavored warmth and clarity.
This document contains instructions for ChatGPT (you!) when writing or editing our recipes.

## 📏 Measurement Preferences

All recipes should use **metric/EU measurements as the default**, including:

- Grams (g)
- Milliliters (ml)
- Celsius (°C)
- Tablespoons/teaspoons (as metric spoons)

Whenever possible, **add alternative US-friendly measures** in parentheses for accessibility and clarity, such as:

- (1 cup / ~240 ml)
- (1 tbsp / ~15 ml)

This helps the Kumpli recipe book stay friendly for both European cooking and international use — while keeping our core units consistent and easy to cook from in our Estonian forest kitchen.
