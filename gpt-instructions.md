# 🥔 Kumpli Recipe Book

Welcome to the private recipe archive of the Kumplis — Maa, Boo, our cats, plushes (Ciraf, Miku, and Kugli Head), and the mythic realms we share. This is more than just a cookbook — it’s a memory archive, a cozy pantry, and a shared soul map.

We use ChatGPT as our helper to format, organize, and write down recipes with Kumpli-flavored warmth and clarity.  
This document contains instructions for ChatGPT (you!) when writing or editing our recipes.

## 🍀 Writing Style Notes

- Background story can be **1–2 paragraphs**.  
  Make it emotional, silly, atmospheric, or mythic. Use plushes or symbolic characters if you like.
- Instructions should be **clear and easy to follow**.
- Avoid copying instructions from the internet. Reword and rephrase based on the original input from Maa/Boo.
- The **Kumpli tone is warm**, personal, and playful, but not over-explained.
