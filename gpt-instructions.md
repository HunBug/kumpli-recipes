# ü•î Kumpli Recipe Book

Welcome to the private recipe archive of the Kumplis ‚Äî Maa, Boo, our cats, plushes (Ciraf, Miku, and Kugli Head), and the mythic realms we share. This is more than just a cookbook ‚Äî it‚Äôs a memory archive, a cozy pantry, and a shared soul map.

This document contains instructions for ChatGPT (you!) when writing or editing our recipes.

## üìè Measurement Preferences

All recipes should use **metric/EU measurements as the default**, including:

- Grams (g)
- Milliliters (ml)

- Tablespoons/teaspoons (as metric spoons)

Whenever possible, **add alternative US-friendly measures** in parentheses for accessibility and clarity, such as:

This helps the Kumpli recipe book stay friendly for both European cooking and international use ‚Äî while keeping our core units consistent and easy to cook from in our Estonian forest kitchen.

## üñºÔ∏è Image linking rules (must follow)

Use these exact conventions so images render in the repo and the ebook builder can auto-optimize them:

- Paths in recipe markdown are always relative to the recipe file.
  - Illustrations: `../images/illustrations/<name>.png`
  - Photos: `../images/photos/<name>-p1.png`, `-p2.png`, `-p3.png`, etc.
- File naming:
  - Default slug is the recipe filename (without `.md`). Examples:
    - `recipes/batata_and_coconut_soup.md` ‚Üí illustration `../images/illustrations/batata_and_coconut_soup.png`; photos `../images/photos/batata_and_coconut_soup-p1.png`, `-p2.png`, `-p3.png`.
    - `recipes/choo-night-bibimbap-bowl.md` ‚Üí illustration `../images/illustrations/choo-night-bibimbap-bowl.png`; photos `../images/photos/choo-night-bibimbap-bowl-p1.png`, `-p2.png`.
  - If a more descriptive illustration name already exists (e.g., `seoul_smasher_truck_scene.png`), use that exact file name under `../images/illustrations/`.
  - Photos always use the pattern `<slug>-p1.png`, `<slug>-p2.png`, `<slug>-p3.png`.
- Alt text and captions:
  - Provide a short, human alt text inside `![ ... ]`.
  - Put a one-line italic caption on the next line.
- Do NOT link to `optimized-images/` in recipes. The ebook tool auto-rewrites `../images/.../*.png` (or .jpg) to `optimized-images/.../*.jpg` during build.

Examples:

```markdown
![Elf Maa sprinkling katsuobushi magic](../images/illustrations/the_ultimate_okonomiyaki.png)
*Falling flakes or pixie dust? Only Maa knows ‚Äî but the okonomiyaki listens.*

### üçî Two bites
![The Cs√ºl√∂k Burger in all its glory](../images/photos/seoul_smasher-p1.png)
*Two bites, two moods ‚Äî crunchy slaw snap vs. classic comfort.*
```
