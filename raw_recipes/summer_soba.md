Ah, summer soba — a dish as refreshing as a breeze through bamboo leaves! ☀️🍜 This chilled Japanese noodle dish is simplicity and elegance in a bowl, often known as **Zaru Soba** or **Mori Soba**, and it’s traditionally made with buckwheat noodles served cold with a dipping sauce (*mentsuyu*), garnishes, and sometimes a touch of wasabi or grated daikon.

Let’s craft it the **authentic Japanese way**, no shortcuts, no restrictions — just pure, cooling soba perfection.

### 🍜 **Classic Summer Soba (Zaru Soba)**

* Ice and water (for chilling)

##### For the dipping sauce (*mentsuyu*):

* 1 cup **dashi stock** (kombu + bonito flakes preferred for full umami)
* 1/4 cup **soy sauce** (Koikuchi shoyu, the standard dark soy)
* 1/4 cup **mirin**
* 1 tsp **sugar** (optional, adjust to taste)

##### Garnishes:

* Finely chopped **scallions**

### 🔪 Preparation Steps

#### 1. **Make the Mentsuyu (dipping sauce):**

1. In a small saucepan, combine **dashi**, **soy sauce**, **mirin**, and **sugar**.
2. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce and simmer for 2–3 minutes.
3. Let it cool to room temp, then chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. (Can be made ahead!)

> Pro tip: For extra depth, steep a piece of kombu or a dried shiitake mushroom in the mentsuyu overnight.

#### 2. **Cook the soba noodles:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil — **no salt needed**.
2. Add the soba noodles, stir gently to separate, and cook according to package (usually 5–7 minutes).
3. Drain and **immediately rinse** under cold running water, rubbing the noodles gently with your hands to remove starch.
4. Once cool, **plunge into an ice water bath** for a few minutes to chill completely.
5. Drain and set aside on a **zaru** (bamboo mat) or a plate. Sprinkle with shredded **nori** if desired.

#### 3. **Assemble & Serve:**

1. Portion noodles onto serving plates.
2. Pour chilled mentsuyu into individual dipping bowls.
3. Serve garnishes on the side — each diner customizes their dip to taste.
