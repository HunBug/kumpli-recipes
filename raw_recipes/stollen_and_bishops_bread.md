---

🥣 Instructions

1. Prepare the fruit (a few hours ahead or overnight)

Soak raisins, cranberries, peels, and almonds in rum or orange juice.
Cover and let them drink it all up.


---

2. Make the dough

1. Warm the milk (not hot).


2. Add yeast + 1 tsp sugar → let sit until foamy (5–10 min).


3. In a bowl, mix flour, sugar, spices, salt, lemon zest.


4. Add the yeast mixture, egg, vanilla, and softened butter.


5. Knead until smooth (about 8–10 minutes). It will be soft but shouldn’t stick badly.

3. Add the fruit

Strain extra liquid if any remains.
Knead fruit + nuts into the dough gently.


---

4. First rise

Cover and let rise 1–1.5 hours, until puffy.


---

5. Shape your stollen

You have 3 traditional options:

✔ Classic fold

Flatten dough into an oval → fold one long side over ⅓ of the way → press lightly.

✔ Fat oval loaf (easiest)

Just shape into a chubby oval, rustic and lovely.

✔ Marzipan stollen

Flatten → place marzipan log → fold dough over it and seal.


---

6. Second rise

Let it rest 30 minutes.


---

7. Bake

Bake at 170°C (340°F) for 35–45 minutes
(or 50–55 minutes if very large).
It should be golden and firm.


---

8. Finish the magic ✨

While still hot:

Brush with melted butter

Dust very generously with powdered sugar
Let cool → then dust again.
This thick sugar coating preserves it.



---

🕰️ Aging (traditional but optional)

Stollen improves after 3–7 days wrapped tightly in foil.
But don’t worry — fresh is delicious too!

Here’s a traditional, old-fashioned Bishop’s Bread that stays very true to the original style:

🍞✨ Authentic Bishop’s Bread (Classic European Style)

Ingredients

(Makes one loaf)

4 large eggs, separated

150 g / ¾ cup sugar

120 g / 1 cup all-purpose flour

1 tsp baking powder

Pinch of salt

120 g / ½ cup butter, melted and cooled

100 g walnuts, roughly chopped

100 g almonds, chopped or slivered

150 g dried fruits (traditional mix: raisins, chopped dates, figs, or candied cherries)

100 g dark chocolate, chopped (optional but traditional in many versions)

1 tsp vanilla extract

Zest of 1 lemon (optional but lovely)



---

🥣 Instructions

1. Prep the mix-ins

Toss the dried fruits, nuts, and chocolate in 2 tbsp of the flour (taken from your measured flour). This keeps them from sinking.

2. Make the batter

1. Preheat oven to 170°C / 340°F.


2. Grease and line a loaf pan.


3. Whip the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff peaks form.


4. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks + sugar until pale and fluffy.


5. Fold in the melted butter and vanilla.


6. Mix in the rest of the flour + baking powder.


7. Fold in the egg whites gently to keep things airy.



3. Add the goodies 🍫🌰🍒

Fold in your flour-coated nuts, fruits, and chocolate.

4. Bake

Pour into the pan and bake for 45–60 minutes, depending on your oven.
It’s ready when a skewer comes out clean (a little melted chocolate is okay).

5. Cool & slice

Let it cool completely — bishop’s bread slices best after resting.

🍷 Serving suggestions

Serve thin slices with coffee or mulled wine.

It pairs wonderfully with your strawberry syrup drizzled lightly on top.

Wrap slices in parchment for gifting — super traditional!
