## 🥬 Cold & Crunchy Chili Cabbage Salad — Adjusted for 300g Cabbage

### 🛒 Ingredients (Updated for 300g cabbage)

* **300g cabbage**, finely shredded
* **1 medium carrot**, grated (or about 70–100g)
* **1 tsp salt** (for sweating — downscaled to prevent over-salting)
* **1 tbsp sugar**
* **2 tbsp white wine vinegar** (or plain white vinegar)
* **1 tbsp neutral oil** (sunflower, rapeseed, etc.)
* **3/4 tsp chili flakes** (or adjust to taste)
* **A few grinds of black pepper**
* *(Optional garnish)* Extra chili flakes or chili oil on top

### 🔪 Preparation Steps

#### 1. **Sweat the Cabbage**

* In a large bowl, mix **300g shredded cabbage** with **1 tsp salt**.
* Let it sit for **30 minutes**, tossing once or twice.
* This softens the cabbage and draws out water while keeping it crisp.

#### 2. **Drain & Squeeze**

* Gently squeeze the cabbage by hand (or in a sieve) to remove excess moisture.
* Return to a clean bowl.

#### 3. **Add the Carrot**

* Mix in the **grated carrot**.

#### 4. **Make the Dressing**

In a small pan, gently heat:

* **1 tbsp sugar**
* **2 tbsp vinegar**
* **1 tbsp oil**
* **3/4 tsp chili flakes**
* A few grinds of **black pepper**

Once it begins to bubble, stir to dissolve the sugar, then **immediately pour over the cabbage and carrot mix**.

#### 5. **Toss & Marinate**

* Mix thoroughly to coat everything.
* Let rest at **room temp for 15–20 minutes**, then **chill for 30–60 minutes** in the fridge.
