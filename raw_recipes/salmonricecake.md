## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### 1. Cook the Rice

1. Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs mostly clear.
2. Add rice, water, and ½ tsp salt to a pot. Bring to a boil.
3. Once boiling, reduce to low heat, cover with a lid, and cook for about **12–15 minutes** until the water is absorbed.
4. Turn off the heat and let it sit, covered, for another **5–10 minutes**.
5. Fluff with a fork and let it cool a bit. You want it **warm or room temp**, not piping hot.

---

### 2. Prepare the Salmon (Raw Version)

1. Check the salmon for any remaining bones and remove them.
2. Cut it into small cubes, then either:

   * **Finely chop with a knife** until it’s almost like a coarse mince, or
   * Pulse briefly in a food processor (don’t overdo it; you don’t want paste).
3. Pat dry gently with a paper towel if it’s very wet.

---

### 3. Make the Salmon Rice Mixture

1. In a large bowl, add:

   * 1½ cups cooked rice
   * Minced/chopped salmon
   * 1 egg
   * 3 tbsp breadcrumbs
   * Herbs
   * Dijon mustard (if using)
   * Grated cheese (if using)
   * Salt and pepper
2. Mix well with a spoon or your hands until everything is evenly combined.
3. Check the texture:

   * If it feels **too loose or wet**, add another **1 tbsp breadcrumbs** (or two) until it holds together when you press it.
   * It should be soft but **shapeable**, like a slightly sticky meatball mixture.

---

### 4. Shape & Chill the Cakes

1. With slightly damp hands, form **6–8 patties**, about the size of your palm and around 1–1.5 cm thick.
2. Place them on a plate or tray.
3. If you have time, refrigerate for **10–15 minutes** – this helps them set and makes frying easier.

---

### 5. Fry the Salmon Rice Cakes

1. Heat 2–3 tbsp oil in a non-stick pan over **medium heat**.
2. When the oil is hot, gently add the patties. Don’t overcrowd the pan.
3. Fry for about **4–5 minutes per side**, until:

   * Deep golden brown on the outside
   * Salmon cooked through in the middle (it will turn opaque and firm)
4. Place them on a plate lined with paper towel to remove excess oil.

---

### 6. Make the Garlic Yogurt Dip

1. In a small bowl, combine:

   * Yogurt
   * Garlic
   * Lemon juice
   * Herbs
   * Salt & pepper
2. Stir until smooth. Taste and adjust:

   * More lemon for acidity
   * More salt/pepper for punch
3. Drizzle a bit of olive oil on top and sprinkle extra herbs if you like.

---

### 7. Serve

* Serve the **warm salmon rice cakes** with the **garlic yogurt dip** on the side.
* Lovely with:

  * A green salad
  * Steamed or roasted vegetables
  * Or just lots of toasted bread for dipping!

## 📝 Using Shop Sliced or Smoked Salmon Instead

If you want to use **shop sliced salmon** (like cold-smoked salmon slices or lightly cured):

* Use **150–180 g smoked or sliced salmon**, finely chopped.
* Reduce the salt in the mixture (smoked salmon is already salty!). Start with just a little pinch, then taste a tiny bit of the raw mix.
* Everything else stays the same, but:

  * The cakes will have a stronger, smokier flavor.
  * They’ll cook a bit faster since smoked salmon is already “cured” – you mostly need to bind and heat through, so **3–4 minutes per side** may be enough.

You can also do a **50/50 mix**: 100 g raw salmon + 80–100 g smoked, for a really nice depth of flavor.

If you’d like, I can also give you a **shopping list formatted for quick ordering (Instacart / Amazon Fresh style)** for either the raw salmon version or the smoked salmon version.
