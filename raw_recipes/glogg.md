Traditional Scandinavian Glögg (Classic Version)
Ingredients
1 bottle dry red wine (750 ml)
1 cup aquavit or vodka (0.5 cup to milder) 
0.5 cup granulated sugar (adjust to taste)
2 cinnamon sticks
6–8 whole cloves
1 tbsp cardamom pods, lightly crushed
1 small piece fresh ginger (optional but lovely)
1 strip orange peel (no white pith)
Optional: 1 star anise (not strictly traditional, but festive ✨)
For serving
Blanched almonds, chopped
Golden raisins
Method
Infuse the spirits
Combine aquavit/vodka, sugar, and all spices in a jar or bowl.
Cover and let steep overnight (or up to 48 hours) at room temp.
👉 This is where the magic deepens.
Strain
Remove spices and orange peel.
Heat gently
Add the spiced alcohol to the red wine in a pot.
Warm very gently over low heat — never boil (we want cozy, not cooked).
Taste & adjust
More sugar? A splash more spirits? Trust your festive instincts 🎄
Serve
Ladle into mugs, add a spoonful of raisins and chopped almonds.
🌟 Pro Nordic Tips
Traditionally, glögg is stronger and sweeter than other mulled wines.
It gets better after a day or two, so it’s perfect for prepping ahead.
Serve with ginger snaps (pepparkakor) or saffron buns for full Scandinavian vibes.
