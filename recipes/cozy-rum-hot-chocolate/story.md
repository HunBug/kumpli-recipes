## Background

Each winter, when the Northern Forest turns into a vast cathedral of shimmering white, the Elf leaves the warm cabin behind and travels north with her faithful reindeer. They camp beneath tall pines, where the world becomes soft and endless. The Elf meditates there for days, melting little pockets of snow with gentle magic or planting tomatoes she brought from home — tiny sparks of life in a land that sleeps. Sometimes she sits for hours watching her reindeer toss pine cones into the air, playful as drifting snowflakes.

When she finally returns to the southern cabin, carrying the stillness of the northern winds, **Gombocom** is already waiting. She stands on a stool, stirring a steaming pot almost too big for her tiny blue hands. Two versions are always prepared:
– **a rum-warmed mug for the Elf**,
– and a **chili-spiced hot chocolate** for Gombocom, Ciraf, and Silt, who are far too small (and far too mischievous) for alcohol but adore a playful winter burn.

The moment the Elf steps inside, snow still clinging to her cloak, the entire kitchen seems to exhale — a soft return, a warm welcome, and a reminder that winter's quietude always leads back to shared cups and glowing cheeks.

## Kumpli Notes

When Maa and Boo drink this hot chocolate in their own winter, a gentle echo appears inside them. They feel the Elf warming her hands after days in the snow, Gombocom humming proudly beside the pot, Ciraf wiggling her ears at the chili spark, and Silt quietly enjoying her cup.

Even in the coldest months, this drink reminds all Kumplis — outer and inner — that warmth is something we share, and something that always finds its way home.

*Gomboc offers a mug far bigger than herself — a warm welcome-home gift for the Elf returning from the northern snows.*

### Winter Outside, Warmth Inside

*In the quiet snowfall outside their cottage, Maa and Boo share a warm moment — and the rising steam from a giant mug reveals gentle dream-shapes of their inner figures: the meditating Elf, Gomboc with her tiny cup, and the soft reindeer watching over them.*
