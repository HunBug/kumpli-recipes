      "step": "**Mix the Base:** In a large bowl, whisk kefir, sour cream, mineral water, mustard, and lemon juice until smooth. Taste and season lightly — remember, the herring brings saltiness."
    },
    {
      "step": "**Assemble the Soup:** Gently stir potatoes, eggs, cucumber, onion, dill, and herring into the base. Don't overmix — a chunky, rustic look is part of the charm."

    {
      "step": "**Chill Thoroughly:** Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (overnight for peak flavor). This step is crucial — the flavors deepen and marry beautifully."

    {
      "step": "**Serve Cold:** Ladle into bowls and garnish with extra dill or a boiled egg half. Serve with black rye bread or buttered karask."
