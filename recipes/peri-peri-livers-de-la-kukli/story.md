## Background

This fiery fusion recipe brings together the hearty intensity of **South African peri-peri chicken livers** with the cozy, wrap-it-up joy of **Mexican street tacos**. It's the kind of dish Boo might cook on a bold cooking night, while Ciraf nervously peeks from behind a lime wedge. It's spicy, messy, and perfect for Kumplis who dare to build flavor fireworks.

This is comfort food with an edge — rich livers, zesty slaw, creamy avocado, and warm corn tortillas, all wrapped up into an emotional bite. It might make Miku sweat, and Gombocom absolutely won't touch it (too spicy!) — but Kugli Head would keep leftovers safe for later.

## Kumpli Notes

This recipe should be eaten with your sleeves rolled up and your heart open. Best shared over a cooking night with laughter and music, and maybe a plush or two watching from the shelf. Kugli Head is excellent at storing leftovers, if you manage to save any.
