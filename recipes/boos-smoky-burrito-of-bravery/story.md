## Background

Sometimes, Boo doesn't need a fork. He needs *power in a package*. This is the meal he holds with both hands — no cutlery, no hesitation, just pure, smoky satisfaction. It's hot, juicy, comforting, and bold. It steams like the inside of a mossy forest cabin and roars like a small, happy bull inside his chest.

In Kumpli mythology, this burrito is a sacred comfort ritual. When Boo's tail droops and the fire dims behind his eyes, Maa might hand him this bundle of meat, rice, crunch, and heat. No fluff. No ceremony. Just a wrap of soul-filling strength. Ciraf peeks. Miku cheers. The bull inside Boo feasts.

*"You don't nibble this. You bite until your teeth feel proud."*

## Kumpli Notes

Eat it like a bull. No shame. Just big bites, steam, and fire. Ciraf likes to sit nearby, watching admiringly — but not too close, because Boo is in burrito mode.
