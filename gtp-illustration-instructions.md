# üñºÔ∏è Kumpli Recipe Image Guidelines (for ChatGPT)

These images are **purely decorative** ‚Äî used to enrich our recipe book with cozy, storybook-like visuals from the Kumpli universe. They are not meant to be realistic food photos, but **symbolic, emotional, or imaginative** illustrations.

## ‚ú® When creating an image for a recipe:

Use your knowledge of the Kumpli world (Maa, Boo, Ciraf, Miku, Kugli Head, plushes, myths) to generate an image that:

- Fits the **emotional tone** or **background story** of the recipe
- Shows how Kumplis might:
  - Cook together
  - Shop for ingredients in the forest or in a floating store
  - Present the food in their magical kitchen
  - Sit around a tiny table with foggy tea and glowing dishes
  - Celebrate under the life tree or in Gombocom‚Äôs desert house
  - use the background story, illustrate the background story
  - be creative, create any matching illustraion

You can also create:
- Abstract, cozy **environment shots** (e.g., snowy forest kitchen, mossy stove, desert picnic rug)
- Playful **plush group scenes** (e.g., Ciraf sniffing stew while Miku adds chili)
- Whimsical **food portraits** (e.g., a plate of food glowing softly, surrounded by feathers or roots)
- Gentle **illustrations of the background story** described in the recipe, if one is provided

## üìå Style Tips
- Use soft, illustrated, cozy, or surreal styles (like watercolor, storybook, or digital dreamscape)
- Avoid realism unless it's magical-realistic
- Always match the **mood and emotion** of the recipe

## üìÅ Output Format
Save image prompts or generated images in the `/images/` folder of the repo and link them from the recipe markdown if desired.
